                  I am Lorphic Tales and it’s an honor to me that you’re reading
                  my bio. My journey with Dungeons and Dragons began with the
                  experience of Larian Studio’s Baldur’s Gate 3. The rich lore,
                  grandiose setting, and roleplaying experience piqued my
                  interest into trying out the Table Top Roleplaying Experience
                  with my local game store at TC’s Rockets, San Diego. Since
                  then I’ve played an avid role as both a player and dungeon
                  master in community events such as SDCC with West Coast
                  Adventure’s Guild, Halloween with Kraken Dice, SD Rocket Con,
                  and more. My passion for the game stems from the creativity
                  the community creates and the role they play to make fantasy
                  become reality. My goal in every session is to make people
                  excited to play Dungeons & Dragons, feel like they belong, and
                  maybe even walk away with new friends. I hope that you, the
                  reader, are able to find that when playing Dungeons and
                  Dragons. In whatever shape or form that it takes.

                  Hey there gremlins, goblins, and ghouls! My name is Angelo and
                  I've been in the D&D community for over a decade. Beginning in
                  my middle school years, I have continued to create and explore
                  vibrant and intricate stories for friends, family, and so so
                  many others and I can only hope that I get to have you at one
                  of my future campaigns! If you're looking for a DM who will
                  spend hours on end, helping you craft your characters into an
                  evolving and enriched world then bring some snacks and take a
                  seat at my table!
                  <br />
                  I have worked at RocketCon and plan on continuing to expand my
                  reach to even more Cons in the future. The biggest milestone
                  in the D&D space would be joining TCsRockets Adventures as
                  this has truly kickstarted my passion to bringing campaigns to
                  even more people! My style and flare is built off of roleplay
                  and story first, followed closely by intricate and intense
                  combat.

                <h2>Eric</h2>
                <p>
                  Eric has been running worlds and telling stories on and off
                  since 1984. For the past eight years, he has been a full-time
                  Dungeon Master, guiding players of all ages through multi-year
                  campaigns, epic one-shots, and countless adventures. His
                  tables are known for immersive roleplay, gritty realism, and
                  worlds where the fantastic still makes sense. Eric focuses on
                  player-led storytelling while ensuring that magic, combat, and
                  choices feel tangible and impactful. His real-world
                  experiences—climbing mountains, spelunking, trudging through
                  hip-deep snow, and even medieval fighting in armor under the
                  sun—fuel the authenticity of the stories he weaves. He
                  currently runs games with TC Rockets, the West Coast
                  Adventurers Guild, and has run D&D at some of the biggest
                  cons, including Comic-Con, WonderCon, and Rocket-Con. He is
                  also passionate about passing the torch onto a whole new
                  generation of players, having led a year-long after-school
                  program introducing 5th graders to D&D. For Eric, being a
                  Dungeon Master is more than running a game—it is building
                  worlds, sharing adventures, and creating unforgettable
                  memories at the table.

                Eric has been running worlds and telling stories on and off
                since 1984. For the past eight years, he has been a full-time
                Dungeon Master, guiding players of all ages through multi-year
                campaigns, epic one-shots, and countless adventures. His tables
                are known for immersive roleplay, gritty realism, and worlds
                where the fantastic still makes sense. Eric focuses on
                player-led storytelling while ensuring that magic, combat, and
                choices feel tangible and impactful. His real-world
                experiences—climbing mountains, spelunking, trudging through
                hip-deep snow, and even medieval fighting in armor under the
                sun—fuel the authenticity of the stories he weaves. He currently
                runs games with TC Rockets, the West Coast Adventurers Guild,
                and has run D&D at some of the biggest cons, including
                Comic-Con, WonderCon, and Rocket-Con. He is also passionate
                about passing the torch onto a whole new generation of players,
                having led a year-long after-school program introducing 5th
                graders to D&D. For Eric, being a Dungeon Master is more than
                running a game—it is building worlds, sharing adventures, and
                creating unforgettable memories at the table.
